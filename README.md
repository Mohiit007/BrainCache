Got it. Letâ€™s **rewrite your README.md** to make it **professional, attractive, and deployment-ready** for your hackathon and future GitHub/Streamlit deployment.

### **New README.md (Optimized & Professional)**

```markdown
# ðŸš€ OrbitalScan: Space Station Object Detection (YOLOv8)

OrbitalScan is an AI-powered computer vision model designed to **detect critical objects in a space station** environment using **YOLOv8**.  
This project was developed for **BuildWithDelhi 2.0 Hackathon** by **Team BrainCache**.

---

## **1. Problem Statement**
Astronauts need **real-time monitoring of essential tools** (Toolbox, Oxygen Tanks, Fire Extinguishers) to ensure safety and operational efficiency in space missions.

---

## **2. Our Solution**
We trained a custom **YOLOv8 model** to detect these objects with **mAP@0.5 = 0.916** and integrated it into a **Streamlit Web App** for:
- **Image/Video Upload**
- **Live Camera Detection**
- **Annotated Results Download**
- **Auto-generated PDF Reports**
- **Confusion Matrix & Performance Metrics**

---

## **3. Features**
- ðŸ”¹ **High Accuracy**: mAP@0.5 = **91.6%**, mAP@0.5-0.95 = **79.2%**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Interactive Web App** (Streamlit)  
- ðŸ”¹ **Live Camera Detection** for real-time inference  
- ðŸ”¹ **Space-Themed UI** with animations & PDF reports  
- ðŸ”¹ **Optimized Model** ready for deployment  

---

## **4. Technologies Used**
- **Python** (YOLOv8, OpenCV, Streamlit)  
- **PyTorch** for model training  
- **Pandas & Matplotlib** for data visualization  
- **FPDF** for report generation  
- **Streamlit-Lottie** for animations

## **6. How to Run Locally**
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourRepo/OrbitalScan.git
   cd OrbitalScan
````

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the App**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## **7. Deploy on Streamlit Cloud**

1. Push this repo to **GitHub**.
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
3. Connect your repo and click **Deploy**.
4. App will be available at:

   ```
   https://your-app-name.streamlit.app
   ```

## **8. Performance Report**

* **mAP\@0.5**: **0.916**
* **mAP\@0.5-0.95**: **0.792**
* **Confusion Matrix**: Included in `results/` folder
* **Failure Case Analysis**: Misclassifications mostly due to **low-light images**, future fix: **data augmentation**.

Do you want me to:  
1) **Write requirements.txt** for deployment?  
2) **Generate README badges** (mAP, Python, Streamlit, Hackathon)?  
3) **Make a shorter LinkedIn version** to announce your project?
```
